		<p>
		Here are the animation definitions that we will use for our test object. Keep in mind the format of these is highly susceptible to change for each different game.
		</p>
		<code>#anim TEST_ANIM [CE10V] 28 1
#anim BOX_ANIM [BN10V] 1 0</code>
		<p>
		These two lines both describe a new vertex animation each. The first one we named <spec><mono>TEST_ANIM</mono></spec> and mapped it to the animation file called <spec><mono>CE10V</mono></spec> - Crash's explosion death animation. We also say that it has <spec><mono>12</mono></spec> frames of animation and that the animation should have <mono>1</mono> frame of interpolation (this will squeeze in an extra frame of animation inbetween every stored frame). Each game has a slightly different format for these types of animations. See <a href="animvertex">Vertex Animations</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The second one is named <spec><mono>BOX_ANIM</mono></spec>, mapped it to animation <spec><mono>BN10V</mono></spec>, say that it has <spec><mono>1</mono></spec> frame of animation and that it should not be interpolated (which requires at least 2 frames to work anyway).
