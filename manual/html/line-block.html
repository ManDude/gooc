		<h2>8.2. Blocks</h2>
		</span>
		<p>
		A block is a set of zero or more statements enclosed in braces. Often, a block is used as the body of an <mono>if</mono> or <mono>unless</mono> statement or a loop statement, to group statements together.
<code>if (x <= 0) {
    x += 400.0
}
</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		Since a block is a statement that groups statements together, they can include other blocks.
<code>if (x <= 0) {
    if (x < 400.0) {
        x += 400.0
    }
}
</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		You can declare variables inside a block; such variables are local to that block. It is common to introduce a block simply for the purpose of making the scope of a local variable more specific, due to limited stack space.
<code>{
    var foo = 15.0 + y
    if (x <= 0) {
        x += foo
    }
}
x = foo // compiler error, foo does not exist outside of the previous block.
</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		Certain statements will always expect a block proceding them. If you only wish your block to have a single statement without having to write braces, simply append a semicolon <mono>;</mono> after your statement.
<code>if (x <= 0)
    x += 400.0;
</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		Since blocks can contain themselves, a series of blocks can be written by using these single-statement blocks. Therefore, the semicolon is actually completely optional and valid for almost every scenario bar the one described one, however single-instruction blocks <em>cannot</em> declare new variables. This type of syntax is therefore not recommended.
<code>x += 400.0;
nop();
var foo = 15.0 + y; // error, single-instruction blocks cannot define new variables
x = foo;
</code>
