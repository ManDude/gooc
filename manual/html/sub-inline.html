		<p>
		A subroutine may be marked as <spec>inline</spec> by prefacing it with <mono>inline sub</mono> instead of <mono>sub</mono>. Such subroutines are not compiled into GOOL instructions, instead the compiler stores them as a series of compiler instructions. Calling an inline subroutine will not output a call instruction with parameters, instead the contents of the called subroutine will be placed almost verbatim where they were called from (in their own <a href="line-block.html">block</a>), and the parameters in the call will verbatim replace the parameters in the inline subroutine. Inline subroutines are one of the most powerful development tools in <em>GOOC</em>, as they allow you to quickly segment your code in a more natural way which doesn't incur any overhead of calling functions, or wrapping a series of statements (or just a single, more complex statement) into a single line that may otherwise be more tedious to copy around, code readability is improved and error proneness is reduced.
		</p>
		<p>
		Take the following inline subroutine:
<code>inline sub Foobar(a) {
    x += a
    y += a
}</code>
		Now, this piece of code,
<code>...
FooBar(50.0)
...
</code>
		will be turned into
<code>...
{
    x += 50.0
    y += 50.0
}
...
</code>
		Keep in mind the inline sub parameters are replaced, but <em>not</em> evaluated, so a more volatile expression like <mono>rand(50.0)</mono> may have unexpected side effects:
<code>...
{
    x += rand(50.0)
    y += rand(50.0)
}
...
</code>
		Instead of being called only once and having its return value stored, <mono>rand(50.0)</mono> will instead be called twice, and the result will be different each time.
		</p>
		<p>
		Inline subroutines are subject to a few rule changes compared to regular subroutines:
		<ul>
		<li>Inline subroutines CAN share names with other inline subroutines, as long as they have differing parameter counts. This is referred to as overloading.</li>
		<li>Inline subroutine calls MUST have the correct parameter count for the subroutine trying to be called.</li>
		<li>Inline subroutine cannot call themselves (but can call other overloads).</li>
		<li>Inline subroutine can only be called if they have already been defined.</li>
		<li>Inline subroutines cannot be part of expressions. The compiler will simply not find them.</li>
		<li>Inline subroutine paramaters <em>cannot</em> be written to.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Inline subroutines also may use different subroutine modifiers, described in the next chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
		A <mono>return</mono> statement inside an inline subroutine will instead be turned into an unconditional jump to after the subroutine.
