		<p>
		It is important to understand how the GOOL system stores parameters in memory and how they are passed.
		</p>
		<p>
		The GOOL system passes parameters by pushing them onto the callee's stack (for subroutines, the callee and the caller are the same). That is, the following subroutine call:
<code>sub MySub (a, b, c) {
    x = a
    y = b
    z = c
}

MySub(10, 25, 50)</code>
		Will first push these three parameters to the stack like so:
<code>..., 10, 25, 50</code>
		And afterwards, fill it in with a <spec>stack frame</spec> which stores information about where the caller left off, once the called subroutine <mono>MySub</mono> returns:
<code>..., 10, 25, 50, <em>stack frame</em></code>
		</p>
		<p>
		GOOL accesses parameters (either for an object state or a subroutine) by going <em>backwards</em> starting from the stack frame. This means that the "first" parameter is described as being in <mono>fp-(1*4)</mono>:
<code>..., 10, 25, 50, <em>stack frame</em>
     ^   ^   ^
     |   |   |
    3rd 2nd 1st
</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		<spec>GOOC</spec> deliberately has no protection against passing in the "wrong" amount of parameters, since that is completely acceptable and expected behavior. Now watch what happens when too few parameters are passed:
<code>MySub(10, 25)</code>
<code>..., 10, 25, <em>stack frame</em></code>
		Since only two parameters were passed, only the last two parameters of the <mono>MySub</mono> subroutine have proper defined values.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the other hand, passing in too many parameters to the left will have this effect:
<code>MySub(100, 200, 300, 10, 25, 50)</code>
<code>..., 100, 200, 300, 10, 25, 50, <em>stack frame</em></code>
		Now, the last three paramaters have defined values, while the extra parameters we passed are inoffensively just taking up stack space. However, since their memory location is based on a predictable pattern, you can actually use pointers to access these parameters. Here is an example of how the <mono>MySub</mono> subroutine can be changed to make use of this (this following code is specifically in <spec><em>Crash 2</em></spec> fornat):
<code>sub MySub (count, a, b, c) {
    x = a
    y = b
    z = c
    var va_start = &count - count*4
    if (count > 0) {
        do (var i = 0) {
            x += va_start[i]
        } while ({i += 1.0}; i < count)
    }
}

...
MySub(20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 3, 10.0, 25.0, 50.0)
...
</code>
		The variable <mono>va_start</mono> is set to the memory location of the first extra parameter to the left, assuming <mono>count</mono> is correct, then its elements are iterated through.
